1.	Write blog on diff between http1.1 & http2 

HTTP 1.1
--------
    1. It was created in 1997
    2. Transfer all the request & response data encode into Plain Text Message Form
    3. It compresses data by itself 
    4. Head Line Blocking
       ------------------
        Established a separate TCP connection for each and every request.
    5. The client sends a request to a server, then server send a response back to the client
    6. Establish a separate TCP connection for each and every connection, it will cause the latency and     decrease the overall performance of connection.

HTTP 2
------
    1. It was created on 2015
    2. Transfer all the request & response data encode textual message into Binary Format
    3. It uses the HPACK for data compression
    4. Multiplexing
       ------------
        It allows multiplexing so multiple requests & responses send over via single TCP connection
        Secure Remote Protocol (SRP2)
    5. It establishes a secure connection between a client & a server.
    6. It uses multiplexing that will helpful for reduce latency and increase overall performance of the connection that happened between client & server.
    7. HTTP 2 / PUSH
       -------------
        It uses Push frame that will helpful for allow a server to send Additional Information to the based-on client request.
